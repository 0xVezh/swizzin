# HERE THERE BE DRAGONS

Seriously. This is a WIP, attemping to install swizzin in its current state will result in a very bad time.

## Beta-ish at the moment
Working:

[x] Deluge
[x] rtorrent
[x] nginx
[x] panel
[x] vsftpd

Not working/tested: Everything else!

Not tested: Anything that isn't Ubuntu 16.04
